                    <p>Nagano Prefecture is situated roughly in the centre of Honshu and is surrounded by eight prefectures, making it an inland prefecture not facing the sea. It is the fourth largest of the 47 prefectures in terms of area and is also known by its other name, 'Shinshu'. The prefectural capital is Nagano City, which has long developed as the gate town of Zenkoji Temple and was the host city for the 1998 Nagano Winter Olympics. Most of the prefecture is blessed with nature, and due to the lack of an ocean, many people in Nagano work in agriculture, and the number of farmers is the highest in the country. Nagano is also known as a prefecture of longevity, with the health life expectancy of both men and women being the highest in Japan by prefecture, and the employment rate of the elderly in Nagano Prefecture, which is healthy and hard-working, is also the highest in Japan for both men and women.
