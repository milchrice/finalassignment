            <h2>Mountain</h2>
                <p>Surrounded by the outstanding peaks of the Northern Alps, including Mt Hotaka, Mt Yake and Mt Kasumisawa, the valley is about 1500 m above sea level and is visited by many climbers as the gateway to the Northern Alps. Designated by the national government as a special scenic spot and a special natural monument. Since being introduced to the world by mountaineer Walter Weston in the 1887s, it has become one of Japan's leading mountain resorts and was awarded two stars by the French guidebook Michelin in 2008 (Heisei 20). The area around Kappa Bridge, the symbol of Kamikochi, is a popular photo spot. Large and small ponds are scattered along the Azusa River, surrounded by virgin forests of white birch, firs and Japanese boxwood. General passenger vehicles are not allowed.
