        <h2>Oyaki</h2>
        <p>Oyaki is a local delicacy representative of Shinshu, made by kneading wheat and buckwheat flours in water or hot water, rolling out a thin crust and baking it with seasonal ingredients such as red bean paste and vegetables. It is also called 'yakimochi' in some areas. It is said to have originated in the Nishiyama area of Kamisuunai County and has a long history. Traces of kneading and baking cereal flour have been found at the Jomon ruins in Ogawa Village. Many mountainous areas are not suitable for rice cultivation due to their steep terrain and cold climate. In these mountainous areas, wheat and buckwheat were cultivated in large quantities, and it is said that people ate a meal made from the flour at least once a day, supporting the diet of their ancestors as a substitute for rice. On the other hand, Sakae Village, which is located in an area with heavy snowfall, is not suitable for growing wheat, so oyaki called anbo is made from rice flour.
        In the old days, every house had a sunken hearth, and in the Nishiyama area, the surface of the oyaki was grilled in an iron pot called a horoku, the oyaki was steamed in the ashes of the hearth, and the ashes from the surrounding area were removed and eaten. This type of oyaki is called 'ash-yaki oyaki' and used to be the main type of oyaki. It was passed down from the village to the town, giving rise to a variety of cooking methods, including 'steaming', 'baking', 'baking and steaming' and 'steaming and baking'. There are various types of ingredients such as aubergine, mushrooms, pumpkin, dried radish, etc., seasoned with miso or soya sauce, and then wrapped in a single ingredient or a mixture of several. The ingredients were enjoyed by adding ingredients that were familiar or seasonal. Oyaki is a local food originally from the northern part of the prefecture, but as it became more valuable as a tourism resource, it spread throughout the prefecture and is now a popular local dish throughout the county.
