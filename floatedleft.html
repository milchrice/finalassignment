        <h2>Soba</h2>
        <p>Food made mainly from buckwheat flour. Generally, buckwheat noodles are made by kneading buckwheat flour with water, stretching it thinly and cutting it into thin strips (buckwheat noodles). Buckwheat originated in China and came to Japan via the Korean Peninsula, where it was cultivated in various regions. It is said to have arrived in Japan as early as the late Jomon period. It is now widely cultivated throughout the world. Buckwheat was introduced to Europe from the 14th century onwards, where it was mixed with buckwheat flour in bread and other products. In Japan, records show that buckwheat was already used in the Nara period (710-794). In the 6th year of the Yoro period (722) of the Shoku-nihon-honki (Chronicles of Japan), it is stated that in the summer, a drought caused a severe famine, so buckwheat was ordered to be planted along with late-flowering rice and barley. The Shoku-nihon-koki, 839, also states that buckwheat was ordered to be planted as an emergency crop, indicating that buckwheat had long been cultivated as a relief crop. Buckwheat is said to have first been cultivated in Japan near Mount Ibuki in Shiga Prefecture, from where it gradually spread eastwards. Buckwheat then became widely cultivated in Gifu, Nagano and Yamanashi prefectures, and today Shinshu is famous for its production. In addition, there are many other buckwheat production areas in various regions, and buckwheat named after the area is eaten, but it does not seem to have been eaten as regularly as the other five grains. Buckwheat is used for food in the form of granulated peeled buckwheat and buckwheat flour.
